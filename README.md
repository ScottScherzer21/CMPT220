# Software Development 1
---

#### Detail from syllabus
Software development is programming a computer to do specific tasks, but it also involves documenting, testing, and fixing bugs. This course continues a disciplined approach to the craft of software development using Java. As a student, you will learn to design, develop, test, debug, and document a program with good coding style. This will help you to form a foundation for further studies in computer science.

#### Course Objectives:
- come to further know software development as both art and science
- understand and correctly use linear data structures
- be able to correctly use the core tenets of Object-oriented programming
- believe in the nature of objects as consisting of data and methods
- be able to design and implement classes for problem solving
- enjoy declaring and manipulating arrays
- embrace the opportunity to develop a complex system over the course of the semester where you have to either live with your prior mistakes and shortcuts or go back and fix them. (Either will teach you a valuable lesson).
- revel in the practice of finding some answers for yourself, because capable problem solvers never stop learning.
