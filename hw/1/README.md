## 1. Simple computation
The formula for computing the discriminant of a quadratic equation
```ax2 + bx + c = 0 is b 2–4ac```
Write a program that computes the discriminant for the equation 
```3x 2 + 4x + 5 = 0```

## 2. Physics: acceleration 
Average acceleration is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time taken to make the change, as shown in the following formula
```a = v1−v0 t```
Here, v0 is the starting velocity in meters/second, v1 is the ending velocity in meters/second, and
t is the time span in seconds. Assume v0 is 5.6, v1 is 10.5, and t is 0.5, and displays the average acceleration.

## 3. Display pattern 
Write a program that displays the 100 in all astericks (*) on the console line.
