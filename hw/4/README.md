> ## 1. Math tutor
> Write a program that displays a menu as shown in the sample run  
> You can enter 1, 2, 3, or 4 for choosing an addition,
> subtraction, multiplication, or division test. 
> After a test is ﬁnished, the menu is redisplayed.  
> You may choose another test or enter
> 5 to exit the system.  
> Each test generates two random single-digit
> numbers to form a question for addition, subtraction, multiplication,
> or division.  
> For a subtraction such as number1 -- number2, number1 is
> greater than or equal to number2.  
> For a division question such as number1 / number2, number2 is not zero.
>```
> Main menu
> 1: Addition
> 2: Subtraction
> 3: Multiplication
> 4: Division
> 5: Exit
> Enter a choice: 1
> What is 1 + 7? 8
> Correct

> ## 2\. Corner point coordinates) 
> Suppose an *n*-sided regular polygon is centered at (0,0) with one point at the 3 o'clock position.\
> Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
> number of the sides, the radius of the bounding circle of a polygon,
> and displays the coordinates of the corner points on the polygon.
>
> Here is a sample run:
>```
> Enter the number of the sides: 6\
> Enter the radius of the bounding circle: 100 The coordinates of the
> points on the polygon are (100.0, 0.0)\
> (50.0, 86.6)\
> (-50.0, 86.6)\
> (-100.0, 1.22)\
> (-50.0, -86.6)\
> (50, -86.60)
>```


> ## 3\. Bioinformatics: ﬁnd genes
> 
> Biologists use a sequence of the letters A, C, G, and T to model a genome.\
> A gene is a substring of a
> genome that starts after a triplet ATG and ends before a triplet TAG,
> TAA, or TGA. Furthermore, the length of a gene string is a multiple of
> 3, and the gene does not contain any of the triplets ATG, TAG, TAA, or
> TGA. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a genome and
> displays all genes in the genome. If no gene is found in the input
> sequence, display "no gene is found".
>
> Here are the sample runs:
>```
> Enter a genome string: TTATGTTTTAAGGATGGGGCGTTAGTT TTT\
> GGGCGT
>```
>```
> Enter a genome string: TGTGTGTATAT\
> no gene is found
>```


> ## 4. Reduce square root 
> Write a program that prompts the user to
> enter a positive integer and obtains its square root in simplest form.
> For example, the simplest form for*√*18 is 3*√*2 is, for 28 is 2*√*7 ,
> and for 3*√*648 is 18*√*2.
>
> Here are some sample runs:
>```
> Enter a positive integer: 1300\
> sqrt(1300) is 10\*sqrt(13)
>```
>```
> Enter a positive integer: 31\
> sqrt(31) is sqrt(31)
>```
>```
> Enter a positive integer: 64\
> sqrt(64) is 8
>```
