## Description
The goal of this project is to create a Java program that creates a histogram from a sequence of numbers. A
histogram is an approximate representation of the distribution of numerical data. The x-axis represents the
values that we want to display the frequency for. The y-axis represents the number count of occurrences in
the data for each column and can be used to visualize data distributions.
For this project, the value entered represents both, the label for the x-axis as well as the value that
represents the frequency.

Hint: Read all the values at once using a scanner, with the nextLine() method. Make sure that your
output matches the output of the two examples in Figure [1](#br2)[ ](#br2)and Figure [2.](#br2)

## Submission
Place your .java ﬁles under the corresponding folder in your local copy of the GitHub repository, commit and
push it to the remote repository. Make sure that the professor has access to the repository (jfac65-marist).
